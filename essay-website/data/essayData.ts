You can now generate a song as easily as you would generate an image or a paragraph of text. This rapid advancement raises profound ethical, legal, and cultural questions. Who owns music created by machines trained on human works? Can such music be protected under copyright law? And what happens to musical diversity and authenticity when algorithms start to shape the musical landscape?",

Together, these sections argue that while AI music systems possess extraordinary technical power, their integration into society must be guided by strong ethical frameworks, transparent governance, and a commitment to human creativity.",

Early algorithmic composition systems, such as the Illiac Suite in the 1950s, used rule-based approaches like Markov chains to generate musical scores \\cite{funk2018musical}. Through the late 20th and early 21st centuries, development remained largely academic, progressing through neural network experiments with symbolic MIDI generation, such as MusicVAE \\cite{roberts2018hierarchical} and direct audio synthesis, such as AudioLM \\cite{borsos2023audiolm}. These early systems produced musically incoherent results, lacking the structural coherence and audio fidelity needed for practical application.",

Google's MusicLM \\cite{agostinelli2023musiclm} demonstrated that by tokenising audio and text into a shared latent space, models could generate structurally coherent music from text prompts, maintaining consistent genre, rhythm, and instrumentation across extended durations. A parallel development in diffusion models, which reconstructs audio by iteratively denoising random noise, further improved output quality. Systems like Noise2Music \\cite{huang2023noise2music} and Riffusion \\cite{coldewey2022riffusion} applied this approach by generating spectrograms and converting them into audio waveforms. The combination of transformer-based structural coherence and diffusion-based audio quality produced the first systems capable of generating commercially viable music from text prompts.",

In mid-2025, The Velvet Sundown, a band later revealed to be entirely AI-generated, accumulated over 1.4 million monthly Spotify listeners before publicly confirming that its music, vocals, and visuals were created using AI \\cite{berklee2025velvet}. The project, framed by its creators as an \"artistic provocation,\" initially fooled major publications including Rolling Stone, which published interviews with a fabricated spokesperson. Similarly, AI musician Xania Monet, created by songwriter Telisha Jones using Suno, secured a \$3 million record deal after generating 9.8 million streams and achieving a No. 1 position on Billboard's R\&B Digital Song Sales chart \\cite{petraeus2025goodbye}. However, other major labels reportedly declined to bid on Monet due to ongoing copyright litigation against Suno. These cases demonstrate that AI-generated music can achieve commercial success when packaged with artist personas and marketing, though they also expose the risk of AI music as it currently stands, as major industry players remain hesitant to invest in AI artists while the legal status of their training data remains unresolved. It should also be noted that while these artists have accumulated millions of streams, public reception has been mixed at best, with significant push back from listeners who refuse to consider AI-generated output as legitimate art.",

This would be the correct outcome from an ethical standpoint as the current arrangement violates the common good by using musicians' art against their will to train models that then create music to directly compete with those same human artists, funneling wealth to a small number of AI companies and away from the musicians whose creativity and innovation formed the foundation upon which these models operate.",

Streaming platforms, record labels, and distributors will be incentivised to flood the market with AI music rather than invest in human musicians. AI-generated content is cheaper to produce, infinitely scalable, and requires no ongoing artist relationships, royalty negotiations, or touring support. The Authors Guild, in opposing copyright protection for AI-generated text, argues that allowing such protection would enable \"homogenised mashups\" to compete with and displace human-authored work, shrinking the profession and \"shutting out diverse voices\" \\cite{authorsguild_ai}. Without restrictions limiting generative AI's ability to be monetised the resulting artistic output will decline in quality and diversity. This applies directly to music: if labels can copyright AI-generated albums at a fraction of the cost of human recording contracts, the economic pressure to replace human rosters becomes overwhelming. The music industry would face the same market dilution the publishing industry fears.",

            "Recent regulatory developments in the United States have clarified that generative AI outputs do not meet the threshold for copyright protection when created solely through prompts. In January 2025, the U.S. Copyright Office released Part 2 of its Report on AI and copyright, concluding that \"the outputs of generative AI can be protected by copyright only where a human author has determined sufficient expressive elements\" \\cite{usco_newsnet_1060}. The Office explicitly stated that \"the mere provision of prompts is not enough to secure copyright.\" This position was legally affirmed in Thaler v. Perlmutter, where the D.C. Circuit Court ruled that Dr. Stephen Thaler could not copyright an artwork created by his AI system, the \"Creativity Machine\" \\cite{cadc_2025_23_5233}. The Court's reasoning emphasised that the Copyright Act's structure, including provisions for author lifespan, inheritance, and intention, presumes human authorship. As the Court noted, computer programs are defined as \"tools used by humans to assist authors, not as authors themselves.\" The ruling does not prevent copyrighting works made with AI assistance, only works where the machine's output constitutes the sole creative contribution. This legal framework, if applied to music, would allow copyright protection for compositions where AI serves as a tool within a larger creative process directed by human authors, but not for prompt-generated songs.",

The Copyright Act 1994 does not explicitly address AI-generated works, leaving ambiguity about whether prompt-only creations could be granted copyright protection. Without clear legislation comparable to the U.S. Copyright Office's 2025 ruling, New Zealand risks incentivising the displacement of human musicians. However, even with updated legislation, enforcement will be difficult. AI-generated music is not always detectable, current detection tools produce false positives and can be circumvented through post-processing. More importantly, distinguishing between a purely prompt-generated song and legitimate AI-assisted human composition is messy. Consider this: a musician generates ten AI variations of a melody, picks one, modifies the arrangement, records live vocals over the top, and adjusts the mix, at what point does this constitute \"sufficient human expressive elements\"?",

AI models trained on this rich history can mimic its patterns and produce convincing outputs. But these models don't replicate the creative accidents‚Äîthey generalise.

The models \"mis-perceive reality\" and progressively lose information about the original data distribution, with unusual, boundary-pushing elements disappearing first. Over successive generations, outputs converge toward \"a point estimate with very small variance,\" producing results that have \"little resemblance to the original data.\" In an experiment with language models, sequential fine-tuning on model-generated text caused severe performance degradation, outputs became repetitive and nonsensical.

This has particular implications for Indigenous music traditions, which are severely under-represented in the datasets used to train commercial generative AI systems. A 2024 analysis of existing music datasets found that only 5.7\% of total training data comes from non-Western genres, with the majority dedicated to Western music \\cite{mehta2025music}. European, East Asian, and American music account for 84.5\% of available data, while South Asian, Middle Eastern, Central Asian, and African music each contribute less than 1\%. This imbalance leads to poor quality outputs when models attempt to generate non-Western music, often defaulting to Western tonal structures and instrumentation. For MƒÅori music in Aotearoa, this data disparity means that generative AI systems like Suno and Udio have little capacity to authentically represent MƒÅori musical traditions, which are built on fundamentally different structural principles, vocal techniques, and cultural contexts than the Western popular music that dominates their training sets.",

Current AI music systems operate in direct opposition to this principle. When AI models scrape publicly available recordings of MƒÅori music without permission or cultural consultation, and then use that data to generate outputs that may misrepresent or dilute those traditions, there is no guardianship and no accountability to the communities whose culture is being commodified.

A karanga generated by an AI system has no whakapapa, no understanding of the ancestors it invokes, no awareness of the spiritual role it performs. It is a hollow imitation of form without substance. Even if technical quality improved dramatically, the question remains whether music separated from human intention can ever be considered legitimate within a tikanga framework. Perhaps the appropriate answer is not to make AI-generated MƒÅori music \"better,\" but to recognise that some cultural practices should remain in the domain of human guardianship.",

The AI track was generated using Suno, while an human music producer composed and recorded the human track in an afternoon.",

Even when listeners could not explicitly identify which song was AI-generated (only 40.5% guessed correctly, see Figure 2), they still reported reduced emotional resonance with the AI output. When asked directly, 75.7% of respondents agreed that ''my emotional connection to music comes from the artist's story, their emotions, and their live performance, not just the sound itself'' (see Figure 1). This finding suggests that listeners' relationship with music is relational, not just sonic. People connect with music because they understand it as an expression of human experience, intention, and vulnerability. AI-generated music cannot fulfill this function because it has no lived experience.",

Others expressed support for human artists and ethical concerns, stating they wanted to support real musicians who dedicate years to developing their craft, rather than systems they viewed as ''stealing'' or ''imitating'' human work while ''reinforcing technofeudalism'' or ''killing an industry.'' Participants also questioned the nature of art and authenticity, with some describing AI music as not ''real'' art because it lacks ''meticulous craft, effort, or intention,'' calling it ''offensive'' or ''uncanny.'' Finally, respondents raised practical and philosophical reservations, noting that AI-generated music cannot be performed live, often sounds generic, carries environmental costs associated with AI training, and fails to provide the connection to known human artists that many listeners value.",

Again, one track was generated by Suno and the other again composed by a human music producer. The results differed notably from the indie rock comparison. Only 27% of respondents correctly identified the AI-generated ambient track, compared with the 40.54% who correctly identified the Indie Rock track (see Figures 2 and 3).

This however, would represent a significant reduction of professional opportunities for human musicians, particularly those working in commercial music production for advertising, games, film, and content creation. These sectors have historically provided stable income for working musicians who may not achieve mainstream recognition but rely on licensing and commission work to sustain their careers. If AI systems capture these markets, the economic foundation supporting a diverse musical ecosystem erodes, potentially funneling the music industry toward a model where only artists capable of fostering an engaged fan-base are able to achieve success.",

The survey also unveiled some consistent patterns in the consumer landscape: people accept AI music for utility but reject it for personal connection. People also want to know if what they are listening to is AI-generated. These two conclusions define the boundaries within which AI music can operate sustainably. Companies that refuse to meet these standards should face regulatory consequences and platforms that flood the market with unlabeled AI content should be held accountable for undermining transparency and consumer trust.",
